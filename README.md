## CIFAR-10-Object-Recognition

· Identified the subject of 60,000 labeled images with altered ResNet18 model and reached test accuracy 94%.

· Used data augmentation operations such as resizing, flipping, rotating to increase sample size.

· Adopted Exponential LR decay by rate 0.9 every 10 epoch to find the local optimum.
